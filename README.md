## vault-backend-migrator

`vault-backend-migrator` is a tool to export and import (migrate) data across vault clusters.

Right now this tool really only supports the `secret`/`kv` backend (version 1 in particular, although version 2 works too). Other mount points might work, but many create dynamic secrets behind the scenes or don't support all operations (i.e. LIST).

### Usage

##### Setup

You'll want to `go get -f -u github.com/adamdecaf/vault-backend-migrator` this project. It will pull down the vault source code to your GOPATH too.

There's also a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/adamdecaf/vault-backend-migrator): `docker pull adamdecaf/vault-backend-migrator`

##### Exporting

After pulling the code it's helpful to set a few environment variables. (These may not all be required for your setup.) These variables will be for the vault you're exporting from.

```
export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200/
export VAULT_CAPATH=<full filepath to .crt bundle>
export VAULT_TOKEN=<vault token>
```

Note: You'll need to make sure the VAULT_TOKEN has permissions to list and read all vault paths.

Then you should be able to run an export command:

```
$ ./vault-backend-migrator -export secret/ -file secrets.json
```

If you are using the version 2 of the backend and want all the data in there:

```
$ ./vault-backend-migrator -export secret/data/ -metadata secret/metadata/ -file secrets.json -ver 2
```

This will create a file called `secrets.json` that has all the keys and paths. (Note: This is literally all the secrets from the generic backend. Don't share this file with anyone! The secret data is **encoded** in base64, but there's no protection over this file.)

##### Importing

Once you've created an export you are able to reconfigure the vault environment variables (`VAULT_ADDR` and `VAULT_TOKEN` usually) to run an import command (remember to specify `-ver 2` in the command line when importing to a version 2 backend).

```
$ ./vault-backend-migrator -import secret/ -file secrets.json
```

This will output each key the tool is writing to. After that a simple `vault list` command off the vault cli will show the secrets there.

Note: It's recommended that you now delete `secrets.json` if you don't need it. If you can install a tool like `srm` to really delete this file.
- OSX: `brew install srm`
- Ubuntu: `apt-get install secure-delete`

##### KV to KV-2 migration

If you are exporting from a KV store into a KV-2 store you will need to edit the path in the json file as well by adding `/data/` into the path after the KV-store name.  Using sed:

```shell
$ sed -i.bak 's~"secret/~secret/data/"~g' secret.json
```

this should edit all the paths starting in `secret/` into `secret/data/`.  Then import adding `-ver 2` to the command line.

### Configuration

This tool reads all the `VAULT_*` environment variables as the vault cli does. You likely need to specify those for the address, CA certs, etc.

## Dependencies

This project uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) and thus requires Go 1.11+.

## Releases

There are various makefile commands for building parts of the release `make release` builds and pushes everything.

You can run `make docker` to build a tagged docker image.
